# ClassTor
A python tool for Classification of Torsion angles

ClassTor is a simple python tool for analysis and classification of sampled conformations of a ligand-sized molecule based on dihedral (torsion) angles. It consists of two python modules (classtor_spectrum.py, classtor_classification.py) and an executable analysis script (ClassTor.py), that uses these modules.
